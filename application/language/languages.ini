; A language tag identifies a natural language spoken, written, or otherwise
; conveyed by human beings for communication of information to other human
; beings. Computer languages are explicitly excluded. HTTP uses language tags
; within the Accept-Language and Content-Language fields.
;
; The syntax and registry of HTTP language tags is the same as that defined by
; RFC 1766 [1]. In summary, a language tag is composed of 1 or more parts:
; A primary language tag and a possibly empty series of subtags:
;
;         language-tag  = primary-tag *( "-" subtag )
;         primary-tag   = 1*8ALPHA
;         subtag        = 1*8ALPHA

; White space is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case-insensitive.
; The name space of language tags is administered by the IANA. Example tags
; include:
;
;        en, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin
;
; where any two-letter primary-tag is an ISO-639 language abbreviation and any
; two-letter initial subtag is an ISO-3166 country code. (The last three tags
; above are not registered tags; all but the last are examples of tags which
; could be registered in future.)
